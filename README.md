## Tutorial 1 
### coffee.py 
 - Basic Python Kivy App that utilises and animates kivy garden graph.
 - Has a in-built PID controller to drive a process value to a set point for a coffee machine.
 -    The PID controller needs to be multithreaded (daemon thread). Laggy without one.
 - Tutorial 2 will focus on flashing up the GUI.

You will notice "# No.'s" in the comments, these comments are there to signify the
order of when the code was referenced in the tutorial. 
"# Not defined in tut" means I did not explicitly sate the code within the tutorial
instead I would have said for example "repeat code for the other buttons"
