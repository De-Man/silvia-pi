# silvia-pi
## Tutorial 1 
### coffee.py 
 - Basic Python Kivy App that utilises and animates kivy garden graph.
 - Has a in-built PID controller to drive a process value to a set point for a coffee machine.
 -    The PID controller needs to be multithreaded (daemon thread). Laggy without one.
 - Tutorial 2 will focus on flashing up the GUI.

You will notice "# No.'s" in the comments, these comments are there to signify the
order of when the code was referenced in the tutorial. 
"# Not defined in tut" means I did not explicitly sate the code within the tutorial
instead I would have said for example "repeat code for the other buttons"

## Tutorial 2
### CoffeeTut2_start.py 
 - Start of the coffee tutorial 2 app, remember to rename to Coffee.py as stated in the tutorial. 
### CoffeeTut2_end.py 
 - End of tutorial 2 Coffee.py app.
 - Pimped out GUI with customised buttons, labels, backgrounds and pop-up menus.
 - All PNGs referenced within this code are included.
 - !! All references to raspberry pi modules have been commented out. remember to uncomment. Reason for this is so you can review on your PC prior to using on the Pi.
 - Recommend: quick-booting the Raspberry Pi straight into the GUI and even adding your own splash screen.
 - In the spirit of open source, you can find the design files for the stainless steel front panel and bracket system specific to the mod on the Rancilio Silvia at https://grabcad.com/library/silvia-pi-1. Any good stainless steel fabricator with a laser cutter, break press, and a machine shop shouldnâ€™t have any issues with it.

You will notice: 
1. "# From Tutorial XX" in the comments, this means this code was explained
in the prior LXF tutorial and will not be covered in this tutorial. Also note that all
sequence numbering from the previous tutorials have been removed.

2. "# No.'s" in the comments, these comments are there to signify the
order of when the code was referenced in the tutorial. 
"# Not defined in tut" means I did not explicitly sate the code within the tutorial
instead I would have said for example "repeat code for the other buttons"
